	2. Thy hand Creation made and guides,\\
	Thy wisdom time from time divides:\\
	By this world's cares and toils opprest,\\
	O give our weary bodies rest.
	
	3. That, while in frames of sin and pain\\
	A little longer we remain,\\
	Our flesh may here in such wise sleep,\\
	That watch with Christ our souls may keep.
	
	4. O free us, while we dwell below,\\
	From insults of our ghostly foe,\\
	That he may ne'er victorious be\\
	O'er them that are redeemed by thee.
	
	5. We pray thee, King with glory decked,\\
	In this our Paschal joy, protect\\
	From all that death world fain effect,\\
	Thy ransomed flock, thine own elect.
	
	6. To thee who dead again dost live,\\
	All glory, Lord, thy people give;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
	
	\instruct{But on feasts of the B.V.M.}
	
	6. All honor, laud, and glory be,\\
	O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
