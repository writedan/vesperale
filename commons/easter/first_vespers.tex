	2. When Christ, unconquer'd Lion, first\\
	The dragon's chains by rising burst:\\
	And while with living voice he cries,\\
	The dead of other ages rise.
	
	3. Engorged in former years, their prey\\
	Must death and hell restore today:\\
	And many a captive soul set free,\\
	With Jesus leaves captivity.
	
	4. Right gloriously he triumphs now,\\
	Worthy to whom should all things bow:\\
	And, joining heaven and earth again,\\
	Links in one commonwealth the twain.
	
	5. And we, as these his deeds we sing,\\
	His suppliant soldiers, pray our King:\\
	That in his palace, bright and vast,\\
	We may keep watch and ward at last.
	
	6. Long as unending ages run,\\
	To God, the Father, laud be done:\\
	To God the Son, our equal praise,\\
	And God the Holy Ghost, we raise. Amen.
