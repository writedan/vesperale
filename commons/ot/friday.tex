	Hath mingled with the heart's intent,\\
	Or with the actions hath been blent.
	
	4. In heav'n thine endless joys bestow,\\
	but grant thy gifts of grace below;\\
	From chains of strife our souls release,\\
	Bind fast the gentle bands of peace.

	O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee:\\

	\instruct{After the Purification}\\
	5. O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son:\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally. Amen.
