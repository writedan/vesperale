	2. That so, with flow'rs of golden hue,\\
	The seeds of each it might renew;\\
	And fruit-trees bearing fruit might yield,\\
	And pleasant pasture of the field.

	With dewy freshness of thy grace:\\
	That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,\\
	And o'er each lust may triumph still.
	
	4. Let every soul thy law obey,\\
	And keep from every evil way;\\
	Rejoice each promised good to win,\\
	And flee from every mortal sin.

	O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee:\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
	
	\instruct{After the Purification}\\
	5. O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son:\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally. Amen.
