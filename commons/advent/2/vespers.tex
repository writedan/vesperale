	2. Thou, grieving that the ancient curse\\
	Should doom to death the universe,\\
	Hast found the med'cine, full of grace,\\
	To save and heal a ruined race.
	
	3. Thou cam'st, the Bridegroom of the Bride,\\
	As drew the world to eveningtide;\\
	Proceeding from a virgin shrine,\\
	The spotless Victim all divine.
	
	4. At whose dread name, majestic now,\\
	All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;\\
	And things celestial thee shall own,\\
	And things terrestrial, Lord alone.
	
	5. O thou, whose coming is with dread\\
	To judge and doom the quick and dead,\\
	Preserve us, while we dwell below,\\
	From every insult of the foe.
	
	6. To God the Father, God the Son,\\
	And God the Spirit, Three in one,\\
	Laud, honor, might, and glory be\\
	From age to age eternally. Amen.
