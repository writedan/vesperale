	2. From highest heav'n he came on earth;\\
	He took the form of man at birth:\\
	Redeemed by death the world he made,\\
	And gives us joys that cannot fade.
	
	3. Glide on, thou glorious Sun, and bring\\
	The gift of healing on thy wing:\\
	The clearness of thy light dispense\\
	To all thy people's every sense.
	
	4. Abide with us, O Lord, today\\
	Chase night and all its shades away:\\
	The stains of every sin remove,\\
	And give us healing of thy love.
	
	5. We, knowing thou didst come of yore,\\
	Believe thou shalt return once more:\\
	Thy glorious reign on earth extend,\\
	And with thy cov'ring shield defend.
	
	6. All glory, Lord, to thee we pay,\\
	For thine Epiphany today:\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to the Paraclete. Amen.
