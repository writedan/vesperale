	Blessed are all they that fear the Lord * and walk in his ways.
	
	For thou shalt eat the labors of thine hands * O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.
	
	Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine * upon the walls of thine house.
	
	Thy children like the olive branches * round about thy table.
	
	Lo, thus shall the man be blessed * that feareth the Lord.
	
	The Lord from out of Zion shall so bless thee * that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long.
	
	Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children * and peace upon Israel.
