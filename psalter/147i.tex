	O praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
	
	The Lord doth build up Jerusalem * and gather together the outcasts of Israel.
	
	He healeth those that are broken in heart * and giveth medicine to heal their sickness.
	
	He telleth the number of the stars * and called them by all their names.
	
	Great is our Lord, and great is his power * yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
	
	The Lord setteth up the meek * and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
	
	O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving * sing praises upon the hard unto our God.
	
	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth * and maketh the frass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men.
	
	Who giveth fodder unto the cattle * and feedeth the young raves that call upon him.
	
	He hath no pleasure in the strength of a horse * neither delighteth he in any man's legs.
	
	But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him * and put their trust in his mercy.
