	I cried unto the Lord with my voice * yea, even unto the Lord did I make my supplication.
	
	I poured out my compliants before him * and shewed him of my trouble.
	
	When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path * in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
	
	I looked also upon my right hand * and saw there was no man that would know me.
	
	I had no place to flee unto * and no man cared for my soul.
	
	I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: * Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land of the living.
	
	Consider my compliant * for I am brought very low.
	
	O deliver me from my persecutors * for they are too strong for me.
	
	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name * which things if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
