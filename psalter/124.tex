	If the Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: * if the Lord himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us.
	
	They had swallowed us up quick * when they were so wrathfully displeased at us.
	
	Yea, the waters had drowned us * and the stream had gone over our soul.
	
	The deep waters of the proud * had gone even over our soul.
	
	But praised be the Lord * who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
	
	Our soul escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler * the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
	
	Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord * who hath made heaven and earth.
