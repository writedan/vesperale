	Lord, I am not high-minded * and I have no proud looks.
	
	I do not exercise myself in great matters * which are too high for me.
	
	But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his mother * yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
	
	O Israel, trust in the Lord * from this time forth forevermore.
