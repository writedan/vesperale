	Unto thee I lift up mine eyes * O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
	
	Behold, even as the eyes of servants * look unto the hand of their masters.
	
	And as the eyes of a maiden even  unto the hand of her mistress * even so our eyes wait upon the Lord our god, until he have mercy upon us.
	
	Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us * for we are utterly despised.
	
	Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy * and with the despitefulness of the proud.
