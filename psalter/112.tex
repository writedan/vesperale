	Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord * he hath great delight in his commandments.
	
	His seed shall be mighty upon earth * the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.
	
	Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house * and his righteousness endureth forever.
	
	Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness * he is merciful, loving, and righteous.
	
	A good man is merciful, and lendeth * and will guide his words with discretion.
	
	For he shall never be moved * and the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
	
	He will not be afraid of any evil tidings * for his heart standeth fast, and believeth in the Lord.

	His heart is established, and will not shrink * until he sees his desire upon his enemies.
	
	He hath dispersed abroad, and hath given to the poor * and his righteousness remaineth forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.
	
	The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him * he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.
