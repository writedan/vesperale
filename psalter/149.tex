	O sing unto the Lord a new song * let the congregation of saints praise him.
	
	Let Israel rejoice in him that made him * and let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
	
	Let them praise his Name in the dance * let them sing praises unto him with tabret and harp.
	
	For the Lord hath pleasure in his people * and helpeth the meek-hearted.
	
	Let the saints be joyful with glory * let them rejoice in their beds.
	
	Let the praises of God be in their mouth * and a two-edged sword in their hands.
	
	To be avenged of the heathen * and to rebuke the people.
	
	To bind their kings in chains * and their nobles with links of iron.
	
	That they may be avenged of them, as it is written * Such honor have all his saints.
