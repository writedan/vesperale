	Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem * praise thy God, O Zion.
	
	For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates * and hath blessed thy children within thee.
	
	He maketh peace in thy borders * and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
	
	He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth * and his word runneth very swiftly.
	
	He giveth snow like wool * and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
	
	He casteth forth his ice like morsels * who is able to abide his frost?
	
	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them * he bloweth with his wind, and the waters flow.
	
	He sheweth his word unto Jacob * his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
	
	He hath not dealt so with any nation * neither have the heathen knowledge of his laws.
