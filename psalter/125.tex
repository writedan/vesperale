	They that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Zion * which may not be removed, but standeth fast forever.
	
	The hills stand about Jerusalem * even so standeth the Lord round about his people, from this time forth forevermore.
	
	For the road of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous * lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
	
	Do well, O Lord * unto those that are good and true of heart.
	
	As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness * the Lord shall lead them forth with the evildoers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
