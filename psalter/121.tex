	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills * from whence cometh my help.
	
	My help cometh even from the Lord * who hath made heaven and earth.
	
	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved * and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
	
	Behold, he that keepeth Israel * shall neither slumber nor sleep.
	
	The Lord himself is thy keeper * the Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand.
	
	So that the sun shall not burn thee by day * neither the moon by night.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil * it is even he that shall keep thy soul.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in * from this time forth forevermore.
