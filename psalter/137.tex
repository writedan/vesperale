	By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept * when we remembered thee, O Zion.
	
	As for our harps, we hanged them up * upon the trees that are therein.
	
	For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song, and melody, in our heaviness: * Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
	
	How shall we sing the Lord's sing * in a strange land?
	
	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem * let my right hand forget her cunning.
	
	If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth * yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
	
	Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem * how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
	
	O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery * yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
	
	Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children * and throweth them against the stones.
