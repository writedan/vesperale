	O praise God in his holiness * praise him in the firmament of his power.
	
	Praise him in his noble acts * praise him according to his excellent greatness.
	
	Praise him in the sound of the trumpet * praise him upon the lute and harp.
	
	Praise him in the cymbals and dances * praise him upon the strings and pipe.
	
	Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals * praise him upon the loud cymbals.
	
	Let everything that hath breath * praise the Lord.
