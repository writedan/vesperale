	I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sorely troubled * I said in my haste, All men are liars.
	
	What reward shall I give unto the Lord * for all the benefits that he hath done unto me?
	
	I will receive the cup of salvation * and call upon the Name of the Lord.
	
	I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people * right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
	
	Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant * I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
	
	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving * and will call upon the Name of the Lord
	
	I am pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people * in the courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
