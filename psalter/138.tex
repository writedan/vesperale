	I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart * even before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
	
	I will worship toward thy holy people, and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kindness and truth * for thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy Word, above all things.
	
	When I called upon thee, thou heardest me * and enduedst my soul soul with much strength.
	
	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord * for they have heard the words of my mouth.
	
	Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the Lord * that great is the glory of the Lord.
	
	For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly * as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
	
	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me * thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
	
	The Lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me * yea, thy mercy, O Lord, endureth forever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
