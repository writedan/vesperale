	I was glad when they said unto me: * We will go into the house of the Lord.
	
	Our feet shall stand in thy gates * O Jerusalem.
	
	Jerusalem is built as a city * that is at unity in itself.
	
	For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
	
	For there is the seat of judgment * even the seat of the house of David.
	
	O pray for the peace of Jerusalem * they shall prosper that love thee.
	
	Peace be within thy walls * and plenteousness within thy palaces.
	
	For my brethren and companions' sakes * I will wish thee prosperity.
	
	Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God * I will seek to do thee good.
