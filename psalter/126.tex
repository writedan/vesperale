	When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion * then were we like unto them that dream.
	
	Then was our mouth filled with laughter * and our tongue with joy.
	
	Then said they among the heathen: * The Lord hath done great things for them.
	
	Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already * whereof we rejoice.
	
	Turn our captivity, O Lord * as the rivers in the south.
	
	They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.
	
	He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
