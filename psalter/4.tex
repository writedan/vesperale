	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
	
	O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honor * and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after lying?
	
	Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly * when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
	
	Stand in awe, and sin not * commune with your own heart, and in your chamber, and be still.
	
	Offer the sacrifice of righteousness * and put your trust in the Lord.
	
	There be many that say * Who will shew us any good?
	
	Lord, lift thou up * the light of thy countenance upon us.
	
	Thou hast put gladness in my heart * since the time that their corn, and wine, and oil increased.
	
	I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest * for it is thou, Lord, only, that makest me dwell in safety.
