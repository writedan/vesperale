	The Lord said unto my Lord: * Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
	
	The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion * be thou ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.
	
	In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with a holy worship * the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
	
	The Lord sware, and will not repent: * Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
	
	The Lord upon thy right hand * shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
	
	He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies * and smite in sunder the heads over diverse countries.
	
	He shall drink of the brook in the way * therefore shall he lift up his head.
