	O praise the Lord of heaven * praise him in the height.
	
	Praise him, all ye angels of his * praise him, all his host.
	
	Praise him, sun and moon * praise him, all ye stars and light.
	
	Praise him, all ye heavens * and ye waters that are above the heavens.
	
	Let them praise the Name of the Lord * for he spake the word, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.
	
	He hath made them fast forever and ever * he hath given them a law which shall not be broken.
	
	Praise the Lord upon the earth * ye dragons and all deeps.
	
	Fair and hail, snow and vapors * wind and storm, fulfilling his word.
	
	Mountains and all hills * fruitful trees and all cedars.
	
	Beasts and all cattle * worms and feathered fowls.
	
	Kings of the earth and all people * princes and all judges of the world.
	
	Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord * for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
	
	He shall exalt the horn of his people, all his saints shall praise him * even the children of Israel, even the people that serveth him.
