	When I was in trouble, I called upon the Lord * and he heard me.
	
	Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips * and from a deceitful tongue.
	
	What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue * even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
	
	Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech * and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar.
	
	My soul hath long dwelt among them * that are enemies unto peace.
	
	I labor for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof * they make them ready to battle.
