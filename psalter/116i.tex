	I am well pleased * that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
	
	That he hath inclined his ear unto me * therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
	
	The snares of death compassed me round about * and the pains of hell hold upon me.
	
	I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord * O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
	
	Gracious is the Lord, and righteous * our God is merciful.
	
	The Lord preserveth the simple * I was in misery, and he helped me.
	
	Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul * for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
	
	And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death * mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
	
	I will walk before the Lord * in the land of the living.
