	Lord, I call upon thee, haste unto me * and consider my voice when I cry unto thee.
	
	Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense * and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.
	
	Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth * and keep the door of my lips.
	
	O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing * let me not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, neither let me eat of such things as please them.
	
	Let the righteous rather smite me friendly * and reprove me.
	
	But let not their precious balms break my head * yea, I will pray yet against their wickedness.
	
	Lest their judges be overthrown in stony places * that they may hear my words, for they are sweet.
	
	Our bones lie scattered before the pit * like as when one breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.
	
	But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God * in thee is my trust, O cast not out my soul.
	
	Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me * and from the traps of the wicked doers.
	
	Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together * and let me ever escape them.
