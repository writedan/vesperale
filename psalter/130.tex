	Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: * Lord, hear my voice.
	
	O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.
	
	If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss * O Lord, who may abide it?
	
	For there is mercy with thee * therefore shalt thou be feared.
	
	I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him * in his word is my trust.
	
	My soul fleeth unto the Lord * before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch.
	
	O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy * and with him is plenteous redemption.
	
	And he shall redeem Israel * from all his sins.
