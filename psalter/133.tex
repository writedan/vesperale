	Behold, how good and joyful a thing it is * brethren, to dwell together in unity.
	
	It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the beard * even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
	
	Like as the dew of Hermon * which fell upon the hill of Zion.
	
	For there the Lord promised his blessing * and life forevermore.
