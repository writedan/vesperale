	I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart * secretly among the faithful, and in the congregation.
	
	The works of the Lord are great * sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
	
	His work is worthy to be praised, and had in honor * and his righteousness endureth forever.
	
	The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvelous works * that they ought to be had in remembrance.
	
	He hath given meat unto them that fear him * he shall ever be mindful of his covenant.
	
	He hath shewed his people the power of his works * that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
	
	The works of his hands are verity and judgment * all his commandments are true.
	
	They stand fast forever and ever * and are done in truth and equity.
	
	He sent redemption unto his people * he hath commanded his covenant forever; holy and reverend in his Name.
	
	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom * a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth forever.
