	Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man * and preserve me from the wicked man.
	
	Who imagine mischief in their hearts * and sit up strife all the day long.
	
	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent * adders' poison is under their lips.
	
	Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly * preserve me from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
	
	The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords * yea, and set traps in my way.
	
	I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God * hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
	
	O Lord God, thou strength of my health * thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
	
	Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord * let not his mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.
	
	Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them * that compass me about.
	
	Let hot burning coals fall upon them * let them be cast into the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.
	
	A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth * evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.
	
	Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor * and maintain the cause of the helpless.
	
	The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name * and the just shall continue in thy sight.
