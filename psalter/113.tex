	Praise ye the Lord, ye servants * O praise the Name of the Lord.
	
	Blessed be the Name of the Lord * from this time forth forevermore.
	
	The Lord's Name is praised * from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of the same.
	
	The Lord is high above all heathen * and his glory above the heavens.
	
	Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
	
	He taketh up the simple out of the dust * and lifteth the poor out of the mire.
	
	That he may set him with the princes * even with the princes of his people.
	
	He maketh the barren woman to keep house * and to be a joyful mother of children.
