	Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up * may Israel now say.
	
	Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up * but they have not prevailed against me.
	
	The plowers plowed upon my back * and made long furrows.
	
	But the righteous Lord * hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
	
	Let them be confounded and turned backward * as many as have evil will at Zion.
	
	Let them be even as the grass growing upon the housetops * which withereth afore it be plucked up.
	
	Whereof the mower filleth not his hand * neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.
	
	So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord proper you * we wish you good luck in the Name of the Lord.
