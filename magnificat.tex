	My soul doth magnify the Lord * and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.
	
	For he hath regarded * the lowliness of his handmaiden.
	
	For behold, from henceforth * all generations shall call be blessed.
	
	For he that is mighty hath magnified me * and holy is his Name.
	
	And his mercy is on them that fear him * throughout all generations.
	
	He hath shewed strength with his arm * he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
	
	He hath put down the mighty from their seat * and hath exalted the humble and meek.
	
	He hath filled the hungry with good things * and the rich he hath sent empty away,
	
	He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his servant Israel * and he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed forever.
